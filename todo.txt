now:
create 1 or 2 basic intents
finish fixing validation problems on package
submit for first review
figure out how version management works so I know how to roll updates
see if I can connect app to our devices before publishing

soon:
add support for french language
make git repo into a package and publish the parser library to pypi
add unit tests to library
add nightly trigger to validate live content from websites to make sure parser isn't broken

medium term:
add docs to library explaining how to set up skill
add user docs to library
export package data from alexa developer console to repo
look at incorporating alexa cli into build to generate package and auto-publish

long term:
detect users' location based on their postal code and guess which district they are in
add support for english schools as well
expand to make the app support different school districts and locales (ie: extensible)
